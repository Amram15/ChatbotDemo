Questions,Answers
"Why should I adopt from a rescue organization?
","Most importantly, every dog or cat adopted frees up space in a foster home for another life to be saved!  In a foster-based rescue like AAUPR, pets are already living in families, instead of cages, so they are better socialized to family life and we know more about their temperaments so that we can help you find the best possible match.  We also make every effort to provide you with a healthy dog or cat or to fully inform you of any ongoing medical or behavioral issues so that you know exactly what to expect from your new"
Do I need a fenced in yard?,"No, a fenced in yard is not required to adopt.  Many dogs do well being walked on a leash.  Some individual dogs, however, may require a fence due to their needs.  The bios of each pet will give you more information about the type of home he or she needs.  Some may need to be the only pet.  Some prefer company.  Some are good with children and some are best in an all adult home."
What if I live in a rental property?,"If you live in an apartment or rental property, we will need to either see a copy of your lease that shows the pet requirements or we can contact your landlord directly to obtain any restrictions they may have.  Unfortunately, if your property does not allow pets, we are unable to adopt to you and we also must follow any breed restrictions they may have."
"Can I meet the pets first then decide if I want to fill out an application?
","If you would like to meet dogs or cats prior to filling out an application, please stop by one of our adoption events.  Information on upcoming events can be found here:   We are unable schedule one on one meet and greets with dogs or cats until we have an approved application on file."
"The foster & I have agreed I’m the right fit for the dog, now what?
","Once the decision has been made, the foster or another volunteer will do a brief home visit.  For people who live outside the metro Atlanta area, a home visit can be done by a local rescue or we can arrange a virtual home visit through Skype or Facetime.  If the dog or cat is medically cleared for adoption, you will then pay the adoption fee and sign the contract.  If not medically cleared or you are adopting a young puppy or kitten, you can pre-adopt by paying the adoption fee in advance.  This holds the pet for you until cleared but please wait until directed to do so by the foster."
"What does the adoption fee include?
","Adoption fees for dogs include all vaccines up to date at the time of adoption, deworming, flea treatment, heartworm test, spay or neuter, and a microchip.  If a puppy is adopted prior to spay or neuter, our team will contact you at 4 months of age to schedule this through one of our partner vets.

Adoption fees for cats include vaccines up to date at the time of adoption, deworming, flea treatment, combo test, spay or neuter, and a microchip.

We also treat any known illnesses or injuries the dog or cat had at intake or while in our care."
"Am I guaranteed a healthy pet?
","We make EVERY effort to treat everything known or discovered during vetting appointments.  However, pets can get sick or pick up parasites at any time.  We cannot guarantee that a dog or cat will stay healthy.  If you feel there is something we missed, please use our contact form or e-mail vets@angelsrescue.org so we can direct you appropriately.  We regret that we are unable to reimburse expenses incurred at vets outside of our partner network."
What if I live out of state?,"Angels Rescue allows out of state adoptions only for cats and dogs at least 4 months of age and that have already been spayed or neutered.  We are unable to hold younger pets until that time due to lack of available foster space.  We are also unable to transport pets to you.  To adopt from another state, we ask that you and your family and pets (if applicable) travel to  meet the pet(s) you are considering adopting to ensure it’s a good fit for everyone.  You are responsible for obtaining a health certificate and any other documentation your home state requires."
Can I adopt two puppies or kittens?,"Angels Rescue does not adopt out sibling puppies to the same home due to the risk of Littermate Syndrome.  We do allow puppies from different litters to be adopted together but we encourage you to stagger these by a couple of months so that each puppy can have individual attention through the training and housebreaking period.  Most adopters find this is much easier and puppies are better socialized and more effectively trained.

We do encourage kittens to be adopted in pairs, including siblings, and any second cat or kitten adopted at the same time has no adoption fee."
"Does Angels Rescue adopt out therapy, emotional support, or working animals?
","Due to the unknown histories of our pets, we cannot guarantee they will be suited to a particular job and therefore our dogs are intended to be family pets and not working animals.  We are also unable to adopt pets out to properties that do not allow pets with the intention of getting them certified post-adoption for the same reason.  We do support the use of dogs and cats for therapeutic reasons and encourage you to check out an organization which specializes in pets who are uniquely suited to those tasks."
What if my adopted dog or cat does not work out?,"Angels Rescue takes back adopted pets.  During the first two weeks after adoption, you can return the pet for a full refund of your adoption fee if you determine it is not the right fit for your family.  After that time, we will still take the pet back if needed.  You can initiate a return through our contact form or by emailing returns@angelsrescue.org for dogs and cats@angelsrescue.org for cats."
